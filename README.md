## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with solid experience in both frontend and backend development, as well as database design and management. My work is currently focused on **modern web development**, combining performance, usability, and clean architecture.

In addition to programming, I have hands-on experience as a **Linux system administrator**, managing deployments and services in production environments using dedicated server distributions.

I'm a naturally self-driven and adaptable professional when facing IT challenges. However, I firmly believe that the best results come from **collaboration and mutual growth**, so I always seek to be surrounded by people with passion and talent.

I'm currently building **Reyes&Friends**, my own digital venture where I offer **custom software solutions** tailored to the specific needs of clients — from small businesses to larger operations.
