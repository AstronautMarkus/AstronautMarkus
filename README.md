# <p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! my name is Marcos Reyes</p>

<p align="center">
As a computer science student, what passionate me is developing useful and interesting tools as well as writing codes with proposals such as a hobby. Also, I consider myself as an anime and video games fan; in particular sandbox video games since my biggest dream is to develop one of my own. for me, having this aspiration sparked my deep interest in the programming andÂ computingÂ world.
